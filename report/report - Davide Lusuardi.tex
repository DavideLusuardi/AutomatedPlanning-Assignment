\begin{abstract}
This report is intended to present and analyze the assignment for the course 
\textit{Automated Planning Theory and Practice} \ref{TODO:assignment_document}
and discuss some design choices regarding its modeling and implementation.

The assignment is inspired by an emergency services logistics scenario where
a set of robotic agents have the task to deliver crates containing emergency 
supplies to some injured people.

The assignment is divided into four subproblems, each building on the previous 
one with increasing complexity.
In the first problem, the robot can pick up and move just one crate at time.
In the second problem, the complexity increase a bit given that the robot
exploits a carrier that can load up to four crates.
In the third problem, is required to use durative actions in order to assign
reasonable duration to different actions and model which actions can be executed
in parallel.
Lastly, the third problem has to be implemented within the \texttt{PlanSys2} 
framework, executing in a simulated environment the plan.


% This report is intended to present and discuss some design choices regarding 
% the modeling and implementation of the scenario and the four subproblems 
% proposed in the assignment document \ref{TODO}.
% In this paper, we present and discuss some methods for free-viewpoint synthesis for soccer games.
% These techniques permit to generate novel views of actions from any angle and allow viewers to virtually fly through real soccer scenes.

% In this document, we discuss some methods to accomplish free-viewpoint video visualization for soccer scenes.
% These methods generate novel views of actions from any angle and allow viewers to virtually fly through real soccer scenes.
% TODO: complete
% and is of interest for visualization in TV productions.
