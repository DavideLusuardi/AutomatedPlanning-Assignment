\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec5}

We have shown how a typical planning problem like the emergency services logistics scenario 
proposed in this report can be solved using the PDDL language and state-of-the-art planners.

Problems with increasing complexity have been discussed and solved, showing how modern planners can 
efficiently found complex plans.
% This remarks the importance of automated planning for many real applications.

Lastly, we have shown how to integrate the planning problem within the \texttt{PlanSys2} infrastructure
in order to be able to execute the plan in a simulated environment.

In future works, using real robotic agents, it could be interesting to implement real action nodes
and to study the problems that arise in a real environment.

% In future works, it could be interesting use real robotic agents and implement real action nodes in order 
% to solve 

It could be also interesting analyse the proposed problems from a hierarchical point of view, extending the 
PDDL domain and problem files using the Hierarchical Domain Description Language \cite{hddl} and studying 
the hierarchical plans obtained.
