\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec5}

We have shown how a typical planning problem like the emergency services logistics scenario 
proposed in this report can be solved using the PDDL language and classical planners.

Problems with increasing complexity have been discussed and solved, showing how modern planners can 
efficiently found complex plans.
% This remarks the importance of automated planning for many real applications.

Lastly, we have shown how to integrate the planning problem within the \texttt{PlanSys2} infrastructure
in order to be able to execute the plan in a simulated environment.

In future works, by the use of real robotic agents, it could be interesting to implement real action nodes
and to study the problems that arise in a real environment.
