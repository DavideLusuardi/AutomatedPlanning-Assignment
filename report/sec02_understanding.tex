\label{sec2}

The assignment proposes four subproblems within the same scenario, each building on the previous one.

The proposed scenario consists of an emergency situation in which there are a number of injured people 
who need emergency supplies.
% to help delivering them some crates containing
Each injured person is located in a specific place and may need some kinds of emergency supply
(e.g. food, medicine, beverage, ...).
Each crate is at a specific location and contains just one specific kind of emergency supply.
Some people may already have some crates and some others may not need any crate.
People don't care which crate exactly they get, only the content type is important.
There can be one or more robotic agents that cooperate in order to deliver crates to people.
Each location is connected to every other location, so the robotic agent can move directly between them.
Initially, the robotic agents and the crates are situated at the depot, where there are not injured people.

The above considerations are common for all the four subproblems that we are going to discuss.

\subsection{Problem 1}
This is the easier problem.
We have that a single robotic agent is present at the depot.
It can perform the following actions: pick up and load just one crate if it is at the same location;
move to another location, moving also the loaded crate if present; 
deliver the loaded crate to a person that is at the same location of the robot.

\subsection{Problem 2}
In this subproblem, the robotic agent can move crates in an different way.
We introduce the concept of carrier that can be loaded with up to a specific number of crates. 
This number is problem specific and is modeled in the problem file.
The robotic agent loads the carrier and moves it. 
At the location of the robot, it can load some crates on the carrier or deliver some others to people.

The difficult part consists in modeling correctly the carrier and its variable capacity.

\subsection{Problem 3}
In this subproblem, it's required to make use of durative actions
% , assigning them reasonable durations 
% and the possibility to execute them in parallel.
Reasonable durations should be assigned to actions coherently with their time spans.
The possibility to execute actions in parallel should be analyzed taking into account real constraints.

\subsection{Problem 4}
Problem 3 has been integrated within the PlanSys2 infrastructure.
